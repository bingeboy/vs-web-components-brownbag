[Web Components draft](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/explainer/)

###Intro
* [Templates](https://github.com/bingeboy/vs-web-components-brownbag/blob/master/templates.md), which define chunks of markup that are inert but can be activated for use later.
* [Custom Elements](https://github.com/bingeboy/vs-web-components-brownbag/blob/master/custom-element.md), which let authors define their own elements, with new tag names and new script interfaces.
* [Shadow DOM](https://github.com/bingeboy/vs-web-components-brownbag/blob/master/shadow-dom.md), which encapsulates a DOM subtree for more reliable composition of user interface elements.
* [Imports](https://github.com/bingeboy/vs-web-components-brownbag/blob/master/imports.md), which defines how templates and custom elements are packaged and loaded as a resource.
