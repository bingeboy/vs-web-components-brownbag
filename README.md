[Web Components draft](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/explainer/)

###Intro
* Templates, which define chunks of markup that are inert but can be activated for use later.
* Custom Elements, which let authors define their own elements, with new tag names and new script interfaces.
* Shadow DOM, which encapsulates a DOM subtree for more reliable composition of user interface elements.
* Imports, which defines how templates and custom elements are packaged and loaded as a resource.
